Microsoft released a hotfix a few weeks ago, and has finally started pushing it out via windows update.  KB2966870 should be automatically installed before KB2919355 now, so servers shouldn't break anymore.  Yay!

I'm now in the process of updating all my affected machines.  Other people have reported that the update does solve the problem, so hopefully this goes smoothly.
