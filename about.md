Hello, I'm Grant Emsley.
If you want to contact me, my email address is `my first name`@`my last name`.ca

I work as a network administrator, managing servers, desktop deployment, online services, etc.

I have lots of experience with:
* Hyper-V virtualization and clusters
* System Center Configuration Manager (for imaging and maintaining desktops)
* Windows server management
* Linux servers (particularly Ubuntu, but I can manage most other distros with a little googling)
* Powershell scripting
* Automating boring and complex tasks with scripts and powershell GUIs
* Exchange server
* Watchguard and PFsense firewalls
* Networking, VLANs, routing, etc.

In my spare time I:
* Play with my 3D printer
* Design things in Fusion 360 and OpenSCAD for 3D printing
* Built a CNC milling and laser etching machine
